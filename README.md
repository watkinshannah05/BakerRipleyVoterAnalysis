# Cost-Effective Analysis of GOTV (Get Out the Vote) Impact on Voter Turnout

Leading up to the November 2022 Texas State Election, BakerRipley, a local nonprofit organization with a focus in civic engagement, worked to encourage eligible local individuals to get registered through their Get Out the Vote (GOTV) efforts. Focusing on targeted precincts and those in close proximity, BakerRipley used four different methods to get out the message with varying levels of success:

* Phone calls
* Text messaging/SMS
* Block walking/door-to-door contact
* Mailing postcards
