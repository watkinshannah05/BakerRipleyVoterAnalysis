# Cost-Effective Analysis of GOTV (Get Out the Vote) Impact on Voter Turnout

Leading up to the November 2022 Texas State Election, BakerRipley, a local nonprofit organization with a focus in civic engagement, worked to encourage eligible local individuals to get registered through their Get Out the Vote (GOTV) efforts. Focusing on targeted precincts and those in close proximity, BakerRipley used four different methods to get out the message with varying levels of success:

* Phone calls (\$0.13/call)
* Text messaging and SMS (\$0.06/message)
* Block walking and door-to-door contact (\$2/door)
* Mailing postcards (\$0.35/card)

Despite the varying price levels, the associated rates of successful contact with the targeted individual were not correlative with price, but rather how personal the form of connection was; phone calls were most often received, followed by text messages, and knocking on doors was least often received (mailings had no indicator of whether the individual received them or not; see more on this in [Taking Outside Information into Account](#taking-outside-information-into-account).

When determining the percent of people in the targeted precincts that voted out of those who BakerRipley reached out to, the average cost per vote came out to $7.85. This came from adding up the total price of all attempts at contact with targeted voters, and dividing that price by the number of people who actually voted among the targeted voters. The distribution of how much of that average cost came from each method does correlate with individual costs, but not when considering how much more door knocking costs than the other three; door knocking made up the majority of a single average vote's cost at $3.75, but there was virtually no difference between it and mailing at $3.68 per vote, and texts and calls were much cheaper almost to the point of being insignificant.

## Cost Efficacy and Its Applications

While the success of each outreach method was rather simple to discern, looking more in-depth at how ideal each method could be for future community engagement initiatives was a focal point in this research. By combining the results found when observing successes, overall vs. individual costs, and voter turnout rates, it became clear that door to door actions were by far the least efficient for increasing voter participation.

When calculating total cost of a single method over the number of people reached using that method that went to vote, the individual cost of canvassing came out to \$97 per vote that it produced. In comparison, all three other methods were under \$20, even though door knocking had the fewest attempts at reaching people. This statistic paired with the raw success rates of each method draws out the inference that it is important to find a balance between the cost for a method and how personal it gets with the target audience.

## Beyond the Target Precincts

Although those statistics were found when considering GOTV's success on select precincts in Harris County, looking at the other precincts can show how much of an impact BakerRipley's presence made in comparison to precincts where they did not engage. In the below figure, all of the Harris County precincts voter rates are displayed in relation to their registered voter populus and racial/ethnic demographic information.

As the % of the precinct populations that is Black or Hispanic decreases and the overall % of not Anglo populations decreases, the percent of registered people that voted increases. In the positive correlatory direction, there is a somewhat present relation betweeen the number of registered voters and the percent that vote in a region. While this may sound like a given correlation, it would actually make more sense for there to be no clear correlation between the two as the general expectation is that rates of voting would stay steady no matter the registered populus. However, this gives insight to the nature of social influence on individual's choices, including a socially monitored behavior such as voting.

# Key Points and Takeaways

* The precinct with the lowest voter turnout was 945 with a rate of 6.36%, and the precinct with the highest voter turnout was 928 with a rate of 75.6%.
  * Precinct 945's population is 89.6% non-Anglo, and precinct 928's population is 29.8% non-Anglo.
* Linear regression showed percentages of Anglo and Hispanic individuals in a precinct's population were the highest indicators of voter turnout, positively and negatively, respectively.
* BakerRipley clearly had some form of impact on the precincts that they targeted, though the extent is still yet indiscernible due to a lack of extensive information resources.
* For better results, reception of mailings should be tracked, younger eligible individuals should be targeted, and largely Hispanic precincts should be targeted.
* The phone method was found to be most efficient, in terms of cost, success rate, and voter turnout.
