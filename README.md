# Cost-Effective Analysis of GOTV (Get Out the Vote) Impact on Voter Turnout

Leading up to the November 2022 Texas State Election, BakerRipley, a local nonprofit organization with a focus in civic engagement, worked to encourage eligible local individuals to get registered through their Get Out the Vote (GOTV) efforts. Focusing on targeted precincts and those in close proximity, BakerRipley used four different methods to get out the message with varying levels of success:

* Phone calls ($0.13/call)
* Text messaging and SMS ($0.06/message)
* Block walking and door-to-door contact ($2/door)
* Mailing postcards ($0.35/card)

Despite the varying price levels, the associated rates of successful contact with the targeted individual were not correlative with price, but rather how personal the form of connection was; phone calls were most often received, followed by text messages, and knocking on doors was least often received (mailings had no indicator of whether the individual received them or not; see more on this in [Taking Outside Information into Account](#taking-outside-information-into-account).

When determining the percent of people in the targeted precincts that voted out of those who BakerRipley reached out to, the average cost per vote came out to $7.85. This came from adding up the total price of all attempts at contact with targeted voters, and dividing that price by the number of people who actually voted among the targeted voters. The distribution of how much of that average cost came from each method does correlate with individual costs, but not when considering how much more door knocking costs than the other three; door knocking made up the majority of a single average vote's cost at $3.75, but there was virtually no difference between it and mailing at $3.68 per vote, and texts and calls were much cheaper almost to the point of being insignificant.
